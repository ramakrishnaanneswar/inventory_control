Files included:

How to use:
1. Unzip and open index.html in a browser (double-click). You can also host on any static server.
2. Register a new user (stored in localStorage). Login to access the inventory app.
3. All data (users and items) is stored in your browser's localStorage (keys: ims_users, ims_currentUser, ims_items).
Notes:
- This is a demo; passwords are stored in plain text in localStorage for simplicity. Don't use real credentials.
- To reset demo data, clear the site data / localStorage in the browser devtools.
